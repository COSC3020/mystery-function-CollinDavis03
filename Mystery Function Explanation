With the line of if(a.length == 1) return a[0]; 
It will handle if there is only one element in the array and will return that one single element.
With the line of var foo = Mystery(a.slice(1, a.length));. 
It will create a subarray that will exclude the first element and will recursively do that until it finds the maximum value with the subarray starting with the second value. 
The line if(foo > a[0]) return foo); else return a[0]; 
After the value from the last line is stored in foo it will compare it to the first element of the first array that has been written. 
If foo is greater than the value in the array then it will return foo. Otherwise, it will return the element in a[0]. 


I used Chatgpt to explain what a.slice was and how it is used so that I could get a better understanding of how the line of code from line 3 in this document worked.  
A.slice is a method that is used to take a portion of an array to create a shallow copy of it and you use certain starts and ends to get to that copy. 
Other than that search I pretty much did everything else on my own to figure out how this mystery function worked.
